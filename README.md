# Omega2 AC Controller

This project is an effort to upgrade an older AC unit with the ability to be controlled remotely

The [Onion Omega2](https://onion.io/Omega2/) is an affordable, minimal, one-purpose IoT board with Expansions. Due to its' plug-and-play-like useability with Servos, it was almost perfect for this project.

In a nutshell, I secured the servos together at just the right width, them hot glued the servos directly to the knobs on the AC. After setting up the software, I had a AC unit that could be controlled from anywhere in the world.

## Using the code in this repo?

You may use the code in this repo to duplicate the project. Just know that there are a few URLs in the code that are specific to my setup and act as a remote console output. These can be altered to your own needs, or ignored entirely if you don't care about the errors. Also, I would love to see what you put together if you use the code!
